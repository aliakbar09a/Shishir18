Boom’s very own public transport, of course!&nbsp;</strong><p>There are four&nbsp;very good reasons why the Boom Bus is the best way of getting to Boom. Firstly,&nbsp;because it will get you into the spirit of the festival before you event get there. Secondly, because it picks you up from the airport and drops you directly at the Boomland. Thirdly, because it is good for your wallet. And fourthly, because it helps decrease CO2 emissions and therefore helps preserve our dear Mother Nature.

In Europe you will easily find several sites for support, accommodation, food and water refill points. Bike shops and associations are available in several different cities and towns, but it is important that you have some basic mechanical experience and some longer bike riding experience before you start your trip. Bring a complete tool kit for your bike and use a good road map. A GPS system or a smartphone can be helpful during any difficulties you encounter. Use sun protection and drink lots of water. Good lighting systems are important if you are riding at night.</p><dt><a href="index.html#i-am-ready-to-cycle-to-boom.-how-can-i-plan-a-good-route-for-my-trip-">I am ready to cycle to Boom.

However, no single tool provides a perfect result. We recommend that you mix different sources and compare the different routes. Your main focus should be to avoid heavy car traffic, bad paved roads and big mountain ranges.
